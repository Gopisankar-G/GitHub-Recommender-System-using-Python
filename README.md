# GitHub-Recommender-System-using-Python
By using this recommender system,we analyze user similarity and recommend repositories to users using the concept of bipartite graphs. In our project, there are two sets of nodes(Projects or Repositories and Users). By finding similar projects and similarity score between given users, we recommend repositories to users.
# Dataset
 Our data set is in the form of adjacency list, whereas the first word is the head node and the following nodes are the neighbours of first node. 
 The word begins with ‘u’ is considered as users in our project and word begin with ‘p’ is considered as projects or repositories in our project. 
 Total number of nodes in the dataset is 22353 and edges are 20001. 
 In that nodes 10721 are users and 11632 nodes are projects.
